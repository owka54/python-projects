Simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 
Completed: 21/12/21


This is my second project from scratch, I am starting to create more projects to practice and improve my code. I am
always accepting of any comments and/or critisism.


When starting this game, you will be asked how many games you want to play with a list of options.
Select one.
Then you decide your move (rock, paper or scissors), the computer's move is random.
It will then print: your move, the computers move and result of that round. If it is a draw, the round will be replayed.
Once all the games have been played, it will print out the final scores and who wins overall.
Then you have a choice if you want to play again or not.
