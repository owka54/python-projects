Guess the Number - Completed 24/12/21

Game Modes:

Easy - 3 guesses, 0-10
Medium - 3 guesses, 0-25
Hard - 3 guesses, 0-50
Custom - User select no. of guesses and no. range (they decide on high number, number to guess will be
         between 0-*user input*)  

         
The aim of this game is to guess a randomly generated number in 3 guesses / the amount the user selects.
There are 3 different default difficulties - as seen above - and a custom setting that allows the
user to select how many guesses they get and the highest number the randomly generated number can be.

The user selects a difficulty which will start the game. They input their first guess and will be told if
their guess was too high, too low, or correct. After each turn, it displays how many guesses the user
has remaining and if the number is guessed correctly, it displays how many guesses it took.

The user then has the option to play again, which would take them back to difficulty selection if they
select yes, or ends the game otherwise.
