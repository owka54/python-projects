Simple Calculator GUI - Completed 03/02/22


For this project, I have used Tkinter to create a calculator program. You can use the mouse to click the buttons on screen or use the keyboard.
It works just like any other calculator, so just input a calculation and click = or press enter, and the result will be displayed.
