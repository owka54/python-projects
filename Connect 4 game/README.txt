This is my first project started from scratch. I finished the 'Learn Python3' course on Codecademy, and before I started the next 'Intermediate'
course, I thought I would have a go at the Connect 4 project. I know it isn't the best, and I know there will be mistakes in the way I have
written my code but the main thing for me is that it works. After I have learned more, I am going to come back and create another Connect 4 
game from scratch. This will mean the 2 can be compared and I / you will be able to see where I have improved. This new version could
have a choice for single-player or multi-player, where single-player is against an AI. Also I can make changes to the design so that it is
more appealing to play.


When the programme is run, it is played in the console. It will display the game board and print out who's turn it is and which options
are available to select (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). These are the columns on the board, if '1' is entered, then the players piece will fall down
the column until it lands at the bottom or on top of a previously placed piece. If the column is full, it will ask for another input. If the input
isn't between 1 and 7, it will ask for another input. If the board is full, the game will end as a 'draw'.
